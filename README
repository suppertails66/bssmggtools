This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Game Gear game Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC and libpng.

Get a ROM image of the original game. It should match these specifications:

  No-Intro filename: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S (Japan).gg
  CRC32:             FE7374D2
  MD5:               33CA01D639AEF0B2FECF2D059175ABBE
  SHA-1:             824E463D0BE5C0E81205A475B5AD7E55C366E486

Rename it "bssmgg.gg" and place it
in the "bssmgg" folder. Then:

$ cd bssmgg
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as bssmgg_en.gg.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
